        "# PYTHON OOPs QUESTION\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and programs. In Python, OOP is a core feature that allows you to structure your code in a way thatâ€™s modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. It revolves around four main principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of its components.\n",
        "- **Inheritance**: Allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.\n",
        "- **Polymorphism**: The ability for different classes to be treated as the same type through a common interface, enabling a single function to perform different tasks based on the object.\n",
        "- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features to the users\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming, a *class* is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from the class will have. A class contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Attributes (or properties)**: These are variables that hold data specific to the class or its objects.\n",
        "  - **Methods**: These are functions defined inside the class that describe the actions or behaviors the objects can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming, an **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class. While the class serves as a blueprint, the object is the concrete realization of that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.  **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        " - These are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - *Definition*:- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "   - *Purpose*:- Focuses on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
        "   - *Example*:- When using a car, you know how to drive (accelerate, brake, turn) without needing to understand how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "   - *Definition*:- Encapsulation is the process of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts access to some of the object's components to ensure controlled interaction.\n",
        "   - *Purpose*:- Protects the object's integrity by preventing direct access to sensitive data and allows access via controlled methods (getters/setters).\n",
        "   - *Example*:- A bank account class that protects the balance and allows deposits and withdrawals through specific methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        " - Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore methods,\" are special methods in Python with names that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). They are also known as \"magic methods\" or \"special methods\" and are used to define specific behaviors for objects. These methods allow you to customize how your objects interact with Python's built-in functionality.\n",

        "Q6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n",
        " - **Inheritance**:- is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the *child class* or *subclass) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called the **parent class* or *superclass*). It promotes code reusability, as the child class can use or override the functionality of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About Inheritance:\n",
        "   - *Base Class (Parent):* Defines the shared attributes and methods.\n",
        "   - *Derived Class (Child):* Inherits from the base class and can have additional attributes or methods.\n",
        "### Types of Inheritance:\n",
        "1. *Single Inheritance:* One child class inherits from one parent class.\n",
        "2. *Multiple Inheritance:* A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "3. *Multilevel Inheritance:* A class is derived from another derived class.\n",

        "  - ### Importance of Polymorphism in OOP:-\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Code Reusability**:-\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows methods to be reused across different classes while maintaining specific behavior. For instance, a method like draw() can be implemented for different shapes (circle, rectangle, etc.) without altering the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Flexibility**:-\n",
        "   - It provides the ability to write flexible and maintainable code. You can program to an interface rather than a specific implementation, which makes your code adaptable to future changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Simplifies Code**:-\n",
        "   - With polymorphism, you can write generic code that works with objects of different classes. This eliminates the need to write multiple versions of the same code for different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Encourages Overriding**:-\n",
        "   - Polymorphism facilitates method overriding, where derived classes can redefine parent class methods to exhibit specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Supports Extensibility**:-\n",
        "   - Adding new functionality becomes easier. You can add new classes with specific behaviors, and they seamlessly fit into the polymorphic structure without altering existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "  - An **abstract class** in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes define methods that must be implemented in derived classes, enforcing a contract for subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:-\n",
        "1. **Use of ABC module**:- Abstract classes are created using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "2. **Abstract Methods**:- Methods decorated with @abstractmethod must be implemented in any subclass.\n",
        "3. **Purpose**:- Provides a template for derived classes, ensuring they follow a particular structure or behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers numerous advantages in software development:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits of OOP:-\n",
        "1. **Modularity**:-\n",
        "   - Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
        "   - Individual components can be developed and tested independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability**:-\n",
        "   - Classes and methods can be reused across different programs or projects, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows child classes to reuse and extend functionality from parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation**:-\n",
        "   - Protects the integrity of data by restricting direct access to attributes and providing controlled interaction through methods.\n",
        "   - Helps prevent accidental modifications to sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Flexibility and Extensibility**:-\n",
        "   - New features can be added to existing classes without altering the existing code.\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows methods to handle different types of data or objects seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Ease of Troubleshooting**:-\n",
        "   - Objects model real-world entities, making code more intuitive and easier to debug.\n",
        "   - Logical grouping of data and behavior simplifies identification of issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Real-World Modeling**:-\n",
        "   - OOP concepts like abstraction and inheritance enable developers to create programs that closely mirror real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Example:-\n",
        "Imagine we're building software for a library system. We can create classes like Book, Author, and Member, with specific attributes and methods. This modular design makes it easier to add new functionalities like borrowing rules or book categories.\n",

This ensures flexibility and consistency in code, as objects of different classes can be used interchangeably if they share the same method interface. This is often achieved using **method overriding**.\n"
